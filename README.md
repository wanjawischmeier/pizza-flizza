The long overdue collectivization of food shopping meets Tinder. A project to organize our food runs during school breaks.

### You can:
- Create and manage accounts
  - Register via email
  - Link a google account
  - Delete your account and all associated data
- Join and create groups with your account
- Browse the catalogue of a store
- Put things from a store in your cart
- Start a store run
  - Pick up things from your cart and that of others in your group using intuitive Tinder-inspired cards
- View your transaction history
  - See what you bought
  - See what you bought others (and how much of that each person still owes you)
    - Mark something as paid as soon as that person gave you the money
  - See what others bought for you (and how much you still owe them)

Using [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for realtime storage and account management.
